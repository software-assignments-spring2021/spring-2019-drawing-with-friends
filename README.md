# Drawing With Friends
Draw pictures from prompts and have your friends guess what they are - whoever 
guesses the correct answer the fastest wins! Drawing With Friends lets you 
connect easily with others, and for free! 

## History
Party games have always been popular, and modern day ones such as Jackbox 
and Overcooked are becoming increasingly trendy. We were inspired by the 
rise of these games and wanted to rebuild our own from scratch while 
sticking to the classics.
